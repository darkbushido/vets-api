    <h1>Thank you for submitting the updated information to the coronavirus research volunteer list</h1>

    <p>We appreciate your commitment to helping others through this important effort.</p>

    <h2>If we think you may be eligible for one of our research studies</h2>
    <p>We’ll call you or email you to confirm the information you provided and then may provide your information to staff working on COVID-19 studies.  Those staff will contact you and provide more information about the study and answer any questions you may have so you can decide if you want to join. Please understand that some studies have specific requirements. So it may be weeks or months before there’s a study that you may be eligible to join.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> We’ll never ask for an ID number or for your financial, credit, or bank account
    information over the phone. For tips on how to avoid coronavirus-related scams,

    <h2>If we don’t think you may be eligible for any studies</h2>
    <p>We won’t contact you. But we’ll keep your information on file for future studies you may be eligible to join.</p>
